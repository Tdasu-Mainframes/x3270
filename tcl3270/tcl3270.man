.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtcl3270\fP opens a telnet connection to an \s-1IBM\s+1
host, then allows a Tcl script to control the host login session.
It is derived from
\fIs3270\fP(1),
a script-based IBM 3270 emulator.
.LP
For each action supported by s3270, tcl3270 defines a
correcponding Tcl command.
The result of the Tcl command is the output of the s3270 action.
If the output is one line, the result is a string.
If the output is multiple lines, the result is a list of strings.
.LP
On the command line, a session file can be named either
\fIname\fP.\fBtcl3270\fP or \fIname\fP.\fBs3270\fP.
Resource values, such as those used in \fB\-rm\fP options or in a
session file, can be specified as \fBtcl3270\fP.\fIresource\fP or
\fBs3270\fP.\fIresource\fP.
